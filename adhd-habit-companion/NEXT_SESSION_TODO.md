# Next Session TODO - In sha Allah

**Date Created:** 2026-01-29
**App Name:** ADHD Habit Companion
**Branch:** app/adhd-habit-companion

## Current Status
- Initialized Expo project with TypeScript, RevenueCat, and AsyncStorage.
- Implemented Onboarding flow.
- Implemented Dopamine Menu (Home) with randomized suggestions based on energy level.
- Implemented Habit tracking with both Daily and Weekly tracking options.
- Implemented robust Streak Calculation logic supporting grace periods.
- Implemented complete CRUD for Habits (Add, Edit, Delete, Check).
- Implemented UI sync across screens via `useFocusEffect`.
- Added Web Platform support and verification via Playwright.

## Next Steps - In sha Allah
1. **App Store Init**: Run `fastlane init_app` (requires Apple credentials).
2. **RevenueCat Integration**:
    - Configure RevenueCat dashboard with products: `adhd_habit_monthly`, `adhd_habit_yearly`, `adhd_habit_lifetime`.
    - Update `src/constants/config.ts` with real API Keys.
3. **ASO Metadata**: Generate and upload metadata using `fastlane metadata` lane.
4. **Screenshots**: Generate screenshots for App Store using `fastlane screenshots` lane (requires Simulator setup).
5. **Testing**: Test In-App Purchases on a real device.

## Important Notes
- The app uses `AsyncStorage` for local persistence.
- RevenueCat keys in `config.ts` are placeholders and must be replaced.
- Fastlane is configured but requires environment variables for authentication.
